Data labeling is an important part of data preprocessing for Machine Learning, particularly for supervised learning, in which both input and output data are labeled for classification to provide a learning basis for future data processing. This system can be used to label news from on online newspaper, articles as sports economy, world, politics other also can be used to label customer comments in e-commerce web sites.
